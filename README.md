# etl_challenge
Project 2

Data entails resources that are used to build a database for crowdfunding. Seperating categories and subcategories and creating a DF for crowdfunding campaigns. The last DF that will go in the database would be the contacts.

To do this: Building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. To transform the data, create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:

- Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
- Create the Campaign DataFrame
- Create the Contacts DataFrame
- Create the Crowdfunding Database

All files that follow these four steps are located in the ETL_Challenge folder.
